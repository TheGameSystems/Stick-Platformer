# Stick Platformer

Based off the original game on a Scratch project (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/375925594/ (the original was deleted)), Stick Platformer is an adventure game where you have to stop the evil creater of an evil antivirus, MFE, from infecting your computer (No this isn't a literal virus, it's coded in scratch).

This is being compiled into applications with TurboWarp Packager.

# THIS IS A SIDE PROJECT. UPDATES MAY BE DELAYED

Early Access: "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1228473195/" an html and windows/mac app will be made soon



At some point I will make a version that will be posted on the OKids website
