# Stick Platformer

Based off the original game on a Scratch project (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/375925594/ (the original was deleted)), Stick Platformer is an adventure game where you have to stop the evil creater of an evil antivirus, MFE, from infecting your computer (No this isn't a literal virus, it's coded in scratch).

This has been compiled with TurboWarp Packager.
